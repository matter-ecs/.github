## A New Chapter

The organization represents the next chapter in our journey with Matter. It is a
fork building upon the solid foundation of the [original Matter
project][original]. This decision was made to ensure the project's continuous
growth, autonomy in development, and responsiveness to community feedback and
needs.

As maintainers, [@LastTalon](https://www.github.com/LastTalon) and
[@Ukendio](https://www.github.com/Ukendio) are committed to maintaining the
spirit and integrity of the original vision while steering the project towards
new ideas and goals. Our focus is on broadening horizons, exploring fresh
possibilities, and deepening community engagement.

vision and dedication laid the foundation for a robust and versatile ECS
framework. This project stands as a testament to her pioneering work in the
Roblox development community.
